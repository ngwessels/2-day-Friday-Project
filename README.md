#### By _Nate Wessels with direction from Epicodus_

## Description

_A company has come to us to ask us to build a website promoting their remodeled building. They want the website to reflect their company values. The company want the website to feel luxurious but while being open to everyone. They want to promote the website to all companies not just technology companies._

## User Personas

## Research, Inspire, BrainStorm

_Here is a list of the companies that I researched/looked at:_
  * _TechSpace_
  * _WeWork_
  * _Hera Hub_
  * _Regus_

_When looking at these website they all have the same goal. Helping customers get nice luxurious working spaces for their company. TechSpace, WeWork, and Regus are all going after the same type of customer/company. They are reaching out to those in every industry no matter the size and offering them something better. And most of them are offering special discounts. But Hera Hub is reaching out to a different customer. They are specifically reaching out to women who are just starting a new business. And offer them education to better know how to grow their business. Decision I have made so far:_

  * _No pop-ups of any kind. Regus has at least 3 and it obstructs the users experience._
  * _The background color needs to be a cool color. Some shade of white, grey, or light blue._
  * _The font style should not be in calligraphy, body font needs to be in some font like Times New Roman._
